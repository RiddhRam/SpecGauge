SpecGauge was a web app used to compare product specifications, and forecast their future prices. SpecGauge is no longer in development. This repository is now public. Some backend features may not work as intended (Firebase Authentication and cloud saving doesn't work properly anymore, but database calls still work for the product comparison tool). 

Known as @SpecGauge on Instagram. https://www.instagram.com/specgauge/
